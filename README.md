# Gulist

Presents a simple list (flat, ordered) of Guardian and other?
content. Lists are personalised per user against a variety of
expressed preferences.

Initially personalising against:

* journalists/authors
* topics (tags and sections)

And also leveraging:

* user votes
* freshness

But note, would be cool if it surfaced older stuff too.

## Initial how it works

1. Grab list from CAPI (last month/eventually use notifications to update)
2. Apply weightings and filters
3. Return

Content means Hacker-News style, but with an image.
